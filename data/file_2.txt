The Tesla turbine is a bladeless centripetal flow turbine patented by Nikola Tesla in 1913.
 It is referred to as a bladeless turbine.Tesla turbine is also known as the boundary-layer
turbine, cohesion-type turbine, and Prandtl-layer turbine (after Ludwig Prandtl) because
it uses the boundary-layer effect and not a fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine.
The guiding idea for developing Tesla turbine is the fact that in order to attain the highest efficiency,
 the changes in the velocity and direction of movement of fluid should be as gradual as possible.
  Therefore, the propelling fluid of Tesla turbine moves in natural paths or stream lines of least resistance
